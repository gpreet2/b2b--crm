# TryZore CRM Backend - Project Status

## Last Updated: 2025-07-31

## CRITICAL REORGANIZATION COMPLETE
Task list has been completely reorganized following security-first, vertical slice approach to prevent lawsuit-level failures.

## Current Phase: PHASE 0 - SECURE BEDROCK
**Goal**: Build a secure, testable, and deployable skeleton application before ANY business logic. This is our shield against lawsuits.

## Phase 0 Tasks (MUST complete in order)
1. ✅ Database Schema with RLS from Day One
2. ⏳ Database Backup Strategy (before any data!)
3. ⏳ Error Handling Framework (can't debug what you can't see)
4. ⏳ Data Validation Framework (prevent injection at entry)
5. ⏳ WorkOS Authentication (the gateway)
6. ⏳ Permission System (no endpoint without permissions)
7. ⏳ Security & Compliance Framework (headers, rate limiting, audit)
8. ⏳ CI/CD Pipeline (nothing deploys without tests)
9. ⏳ Testing Framework (test the secure foundation)

## Phase 1 - First Vertical Slice (After Phase 0)
**Goal**: Prove the system works end-to-end with: "New user onboards, creates org, logs in, sees empty clients page"

## Phase 2 - Core Features (After Phase 1)
Complete CRUD operations, memberships, events, analytics, notifications

## Phase 3 - Additional Features (After Phase 2)
Workout builder, achievements, admin tools, documents, feature flags

## Technical Decisions Made
- ✅ Security-first approach adopted
- ✅ Vertical slice strategy for early integration
- ✅ RLS policies required from day one
- ✅ Every endpoint requires permission checks
- ✅ Audit logging for all state changes

## Critical Insights from Reorganization
1. **Database backups (#2) moved to Phase 0** - "If data isn't backed up, you don't have data"
2. **Error handling (#3) is now early** - Essential for debugging auth and permissions
3. **Testing framework (#9) comes AFTER security** - Test the secure foundation, not insecure code
4. **Vertical slice approach** - Frontend can integrate early, reducing integration risk

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Start with Task #1: Database schema WITH RLS policies
2. Every table must have RLS before any data
3. Test that unauthorized access is blocked
4. Document RLS policies for each table

## Risk Mitigation Status
- ✅ Tasks reorganized to prevent security breaches
- ✅ Phase 0 ensures secure foundation before features
- ✅ Dependencies fixed (no more chicken-egg problems)
- ✅ Vertical slice enables early integration testing

## Dependencies on Teammate
- Stripe integration (payment processing) - Phase 2
- Kisi integration (door access control) - Phase 2

## Notes
- **DO NOT SKIP PHASE 0** - This is non-negotiable
- **DO NOT BUILD FEATURES ON INSECURE FOUNDATION**
- **EVERY ENDPOINT NEEDS PERMISSION CHECKS**
- The original task order would have been a liability nightmare
