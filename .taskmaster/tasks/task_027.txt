# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement CI/CD Pipeline - Phase 2
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Create automated CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing stages and quality gates
# Details:
Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with four mandatory stages: Lint & Static Analysis (ESLint, TypeScript), Unit Testing (90% coverage threshold), Integration Testing (temporary Supabase project with realistic test data), and E2E Testing (Playwright/Cypress with full user flows). Implement branch protection rules that prevent merging unless all stages pass. Create automated deployment to staging environment after successful CI pipeline. Set up comprehensive test data seeding for integration tests.

# Test Strategy:
Test CI pipeline blocks PRs with failing tests, low coverage, or linting errors. Verify integration tests run against isolated Supabase environment. Test E2E flows simulate real user interactions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up GitHub Actions CI Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create GitHub Actions workflow with four mandatory testing stages
### Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflow file with four stages: Lint & Static Analysis, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and E2E Testing. Configure workflow triggers for pull requests and pushes to main branch. Set up environment variables and secrets for CI environment. Configure caching for dependencies and build artifacts. Set up parallel job execution for faster CI runs.

## 2. Implement Lint & Static Analysis Stage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create automated code quality checks in CI pipeline
### Details:
Configure ESLint and TypeScript compilation checks in CI pipeline. Set up Prettier formatting validation. Implement security scanning with tools like Snyk or CodeQL. Configure dependency vulnerability scanning. Set up code complexity analysis and maintainability checks. Configure automated code review suggestions and quality gates.

## 3. Implement Unit Testing Stage with 90% Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive unit testing with mandatory coverage threshold
### Details:
Set up Vitest or Jest for unit testing. Configure test coverage reporting with 90% minimum threshold. Set up test database with isolated test data. Create unit tests for all utility functions, hooks, and components. Implement test mocking for external dependencies. Configure test parallelization and reporting. Set up coverage badges and reporting in CI.

## 4. Implement Integration Testing with Temporary Supabase [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create integration tests against isolated Supabase environment
### Details:
Set up integration testing framework with temporary Supabase project creation via Management API. Create comprehensive test data seeding (10 gyms, 100 clients, 500 bookings). Implement integration tests for all RPC functions and database operations. Test RLS policies and multi-tenancy isolation. Test real-time subscriptions and webhook handling. Set up automated cleanup of temporary test environments.

## 5. Implement E2E Testing with Playwright [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create end-to-end tests simulating real user interactions
### Details:
Set up Playwright for E2E testing with browser automation. Create comprehensive user flow tests: user registration, login, class booking, profile management. Test real-time updates and notifications. Implement visual regression testing for UI consistency. Set up E2E test data management and cleanup. Configure E2E test parallelization and reporting. Test cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## 6. Configure Branch Protection and Quality Gates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up automated quality gates preventing merge of failing code
### Details:
Configure GitHub branch protection rules for main branch. Require all CI stages to pass before allowing merges. Set up required status checks for linting, unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests. Configure code review requirements and approval thresholds. Set up automated merge blocking for failing tests or low coverage. Implement quality gate enforcement and reporting.
