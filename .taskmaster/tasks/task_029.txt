# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Battle-Testing & Chaos Engineering - Phase 4
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive stress testing, load testing, and chaos engineering for edge case validation
# Details:
Implement stress and load testing with k6/Artillery.io simulating 1000+ concurrent users booking classes, 500+ NMI webhooks in bursts. Create chaos engineering scenarios: Kisi API outage simulation, database query slowdowns, network latency injection. Implement security penetration testing with OWASP ZAP for SQL injection, XSS, and RLS policy exploitation attempts. Create automated failure injection and recovery testing. Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all failure scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Test system handles 1000+ concurrent users without data corruption. Verify graceful degradation during Kisi outages. Test security vulnerabilities are properly blocked. Verify automatic recovery from injected failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Stress and Load Testing with k6 [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive load testing simulating high-concurrency scenarios
### Details:
Set up k6 for load testing with realistic scenarios. Create test scenarios: 1000+ concurrent users booking classes simultaneously, 500+ NMI webhooks in 10-second bursts, 100+ concurrent class cancellations. Test database performance under load. Monitor CPU, memory, and database connection usage. Test system behavior at breaking point and recovery. Set up load testing automation in CI pipeline.

## 2. Implement Chaos Engineering Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create automated failure injection and recovery testing
### Details:
Implement chaos engineering scenarios: Kisi API outage simulation (invalid API key), database query slowdowns, network latency injection, memory pressure simulation. Create automated failure injection tools. Test system graceful degradation during failures. Verify automatic recovery when failures are resolved. Test data consistency during failure scenarios. Set up chaos engineering automation in staging environment.

## 3. Implement Security Penetration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive security testing for vulnerabilities
### Details:
Set up OWASP ZAP for automated security testing. Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities in all API endpoints. Test for XSS vulnerabilities in frontend components. Test RLS policy exploitation attempts to access other gyms' data. Test authentication bypass attempts and privilege escalation. Test for CSRF vulnerabilities and session management issues. Set up automated security scanning in CI pipeline.

## 4. Set up Comprehensive Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create monitoring and alerting for all failure scenarios
### Details:
Set up comprehensive monitoring for application performance, database performance, and system health. Implement alerting for failed CI/CD stages, security vulnerabilities, and performance degradation. Create dashboards for monitoring system metrics and business KPIs. Set up log aggregation and analysis. Implement automated incident response and escalation procedures. Create monitoring for third-party service health (Kisi, NMI).
