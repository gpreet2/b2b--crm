# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Environment Strategy & Deployment Safety - Phase 3
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Create multi-environment deployment strategy with staging safety net and manual production deployment
# Details:
Set up development (local), staging (long-lived replica of production), and production environments. Implement automated deployment to staging after successful CI pipeline. Create manual production deployment process with staging validation requirements. Set up environment-specific configuration management. Implement deployment rollback capabilities. Create staging environment for manual QA, stress testing, and soak testing before production deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Test staging environment is exact replica of production. Verify manual production deployment process requires staging validation. Test rollback capabilities work correctly.
